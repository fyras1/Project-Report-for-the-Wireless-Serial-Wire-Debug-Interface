**ABSTRACT**
This work serves as a proof of concept of a wireless interface for the Serial Wire Debug protocol. This interface allows users to program and debug microcontrollers that are not accessible through wired interfaces. 
 
This study will be followed by an establishment of a detailed technical structure of the solution and the implementation of all the intermediary steps.
